## PyScript templates

This folder contains the templates and code referred to the Medium article [Data Visualization on the Web with Plotly and PyScript](https://medium.com/codefile/data-visualization-on-the-web-with-plotly-and-pyscript-a30392f1257a?sk=e7347ececc7e04953cc5633134caa3f8) - _no paywall with this link_

The folders demonstrate different applications of a single template and simple modications to the original template:

- pysplotly1: a simple template that displays a header, subheader, chart and description
- pysplotly2: as 1 but demonstrating the same template with different data
- pysplotly3: a change to 1 that puts the description side-by-side with the chart and with a grey colour scheme
- pysplotly4: two charts side-by-side 

This is probably not the best way to present these templates, so I may change file names and/or folders in the future.
